1 - Not separately retained, became version 4
2, 3 - May be incomplete and unrunnable development dead ends that tried to do too much
4 - Runs interactively only, does not list atoms, but does run line by line
5 - Added support for automated batch processing and way too many options
6 - Switched from tokenization and running logical lines one by one to a single
    execfile() call; also now separate by chain when listing atoms and residues
7 - Add built-in result summary and analysis generation to a separate file along
    with individual motif detail files.  Simplify code and remove most options.
8 - Workaround for motifs that generate final selections with improperly capitalized
    names that don't match their filename (without extension).  Note that this does
    not fix ProMOL's potential problems with them, and there are 4 motifs that appear
    to have a capitalization mismatch between their filename and their selection name.
    There could be additional problems; this tester does not detect if there is a between
    the FUNC header and the selection name or filename, even if the latter two match.
9 - Remove the list of motifs that never qualified (some criteria don't filter at all);
    display entire list instead of just top and bottom 50.
10- Add additional criteria
