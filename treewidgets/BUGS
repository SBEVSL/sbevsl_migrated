Known Bugs and Limitations as of 8/26/2002
==========================================

Bugs:
-----

* When a tree is first displayed, Nodes with children appear with a 'minus'
  icon instead of a 'plus', even if they are collapsed. The icon does not 
  change to a 'plus' unless the node's parent is collapsed and re-expanded.

* When you double-click a node, text may be selected across multiple lines.

* Long node names wrap across lines, with no indentation on the second and
  subsequent lines.

* When a TextTree is displayed with no icons, selecting a node causes the
  background and foreground to change starting with the *second* character
  in the label instead of the first.



Limitations:
------------

* Most Tkinter configuration options are currently ignored.

* Functions for showing the content and attributes of a node are 
  unimplemented.

* Font selection is unimplemented.
