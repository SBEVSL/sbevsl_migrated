Introduction
------------

TreeWidgets is a Python-Tkinter library that provides general-purpose
tree widgets. I decided to write it because I found that, though there
are several Tkinter tree widgets available, the ones I have tried were
all designed to work with one particular type of data structure, and
were hard to adapt to other data structure.

My goals in creating the TreeWidgets library are:

  1. The widget must be able to display any hierarchical data structure,
     and should have built-in support for common structures such as XML
     DOMs and directory trees.

  2. You should be able either to pass the widget a data structure and
     have it automatically build and display the graphical tree, or to
     exercise more precise control through a low-level API.

  3. It should be possible to display a tree with built-in icons, icons 
     provided by the application, or no icons at all. Similarly, it 
     should be possible to specify different fonts according to the needs 
     of your application.

  4. The widget should provide a reasonable set of default mouse and
     key bindings, but it should also be easy to override the defaults.

  5. The widget should support all relevant Tkinter configuration options.

This being the first Alpha release, there are numerous bugs and
unimplemented features, but at least the first goal is substantially
realized, and the package should be usable with a little work.


Modules in the Package
----------------------

widget

    Provides TreeWidget, the base class for TextTree and CanvasTree. In
    general, applications should use one of the subclasses rather than
    instantiating TreeWidget directly.

texttree

    Provides TextTree, a TreeWidget based on the Tkinter Text class.
    Although this class lacks the ability to display graphical tree
    branches, it should give slightly better performance than CanvasTree,
    since TextTree positions nodes on the basis of text lines and indents,
    rather than X and Y offsets.

canvastree

    NOT YET IMPLEMENTED. Will provide CanvasTree, a TreeWidget based on
    the Tkinter Canvas class.

node

    Provides TreeNode, the basic unit of TreeWidgets data structures, and
    its subclasses DOMTreeNode (for XML DOM objects), FSTreeNode (for 
    directory trees), TWTreeNode (for a Python data structure known as
    TWStruct--see twstruct.html for more information), and CustomTreeNode
    (for all other data structures).

constants

    Various integer constants used throughout TreeWidgets. Studying this
    module will help you understand how to use TreeWidgets effectively.

util

    Miscellaneous functions. Currently provides only a warn() function.

icons

    Built-in bitmap and photo icons.


What's New
----------

* Added showContent(), showAtts(), glimpse(), and unGlimpse() to 
  TreeWidget. It is important to note that these methods do nothing
  by themselves; in order for them to do something useful, you must
  supply the TreeWidget constructor a dictionary of callbacks:

      {'showContent': <callable>, 'showAtts': <callable>,
       'glimpse': <callable>, 'unGlimpse': <callable>}

  Each callback must take a single argument, which will be a node in 
  the tree data structure.

* Added default key bindings for <Return> (AKA the Enter key) and 
  <Escape>. <Return> invokes TreeWidget.showContent(), and <Escape>
  invokes TreeWidget.deselectNode().

* Added behavior to the default mouse bindings for <Enter>, <Leave>,
  and <Double-Button>: <Enter> invokes TreeWidget.glimpse(), <Leave>
  invokes TreeWidget.unGlimpse(), and <Double-Button> invokes
  TreeWidget.showContent().

See ChangeLog for detailed changes, and API docs for usage.
