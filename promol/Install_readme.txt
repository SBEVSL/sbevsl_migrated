Installation:

The path for PyMOL plugin installation is typically C:\Program Files\DeLano Scientific\PyMOL\modules\pmg_tk\startup



All files and folders need to be directly extracted to the "startup" folder.

  So double click the zipped folder, then select "extract all" or select all files and folders and select "extract to" and then select the "startup" folder in the above location.  

Once files have been correctly placed in the startup folder it is possible to run the ProMOL plugin.  Start PyMOL and then click on the "Plugin" tab on the top menu.  Then click on ProMOL 3.02, and the program will start.
