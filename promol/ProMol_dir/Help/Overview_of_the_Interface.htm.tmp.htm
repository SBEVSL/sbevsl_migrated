 The EZ-Viz graphical user interface (GUI) was devloped as a plugin 
for Delano Scientific's molecular cisualization program, PyMOL. It features a notebook 
style design with separate tabs to distinguish one section from another.&nbsp; There are 
a total of nine tabs with the titles; Welcome, Presets, 
Settings, Commands, Movies, Information, Advanced, Save, and About. Each 
individual tab has a series of buttons, menus, and entry fields which the 
user can employ to manipulate the appearance of their molecule in 
PyMOL’s viewing window. An additional row of buttons is displayed along the bottom of 
the EZ-Viz window at all times.&nbsp; These buttons are used 
primarily for loading files into the PyMOL viewer, accessing the help file, 
clearing the viewing window, and quitting EZ-Viz.The interface utilizes a PDB file parser 
that is used to identify the separate structures that exist within the molecule 
that is currently being viewed. 
Using this information, the program creates a number of unique objects in 
PyMOL, such as DNA, RNA and protein that can be individually altered. If a molecule does not contain a certain 
type of structure, such as DNA, an object will not be created for 
it.</p></FONT>

<p><font >  <font size="3"><font >This tab contains all the buttons you need to select attributes 
of your molecule (protein, DNA, chains, water molecules, etc.) and change the 
way they appear in the viewer.&nbsp; You can show and hide molecular 
representations, such as spheres, mesh, sticks, and surface, as well as change 
the colors.&nbsp; On this tab you will also find the&nbsp;Chime/PyMOL 
converter.&nbsp; The converter&nbsp;will allow&nbsp;you to input&nbsp;either 
Chime or PyMOL commands into and entry field&nbsp;and&nbsp;have the command 
executed in the PyMOL viewer window.</font> </font> </font> </p>

want to use to view your molecule.&nbsp; Some of the views include 
a&nbsp;default view that distinguishes alpha helices from beta sheets, a color 
by chain view, and a ball and stick model.</font> </font> </font> </p>

control some of the features of the PyMOL Viewing window.&nbsp; You can turn on 
stereo viewing for cool 3D images, change the background color to make you image 
stand out, and even hide the original PyMOLinterface.</font> </font> </font> </p>

chains?&nbsp; Here's where you can have more control over what the 
representations you're seeing in the viewing window.&nbsp; Some of the features 
you'll have control over are the&nbsp;size of spheres and sticks, the width and 
thickness of cartoon, and the ability to make the molecule transparent.</font>
