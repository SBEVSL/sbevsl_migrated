ProMOL READMEThe newest update allows users to use commands that were once only availabe in ProMOL in the commandline as well as scripts (as long as ProMOL itself is open). Here are the new commands that are available!    * batchLoop pdb1, pdb2, sensitivity1, sensitivity2, -(currently Linux only)          o batchLoop can take in any amount of pdb files in the arguments          o batchLoop can take in any amount of sensitivities too.          o after being run it will ask you where to save the file and it will output as a text file that is tab delimited          o there are still problems with the formatting so you might have to do a simple adjustment to make it look nice.    * roving_stick #- Roving stick view    * roving_line #- Roving line view    * roving_ballstick #- Roving with balls and sticks    * roving_sphere #- Roving with spheres          o IMPORTANT: # is a value between 0 and 20.    * surf_over_spheres - Surface surrounding the sphere view    * surf_over_toon - Surface surrounding the cartoon view    * mesh_over_stick - Mesh surrounding the stick view    * stick_and_cartoon - Stick and cartoon views overlaid.    * dot_line - (need def.)    * color_aromatics - shows aromatic rings on your molecule    * putty    * solubility - shows the hydrophobic/phillic regions of your molecule on a surface view. -(currently Linux only)    * show_charged - show positively charged and negatively charged areas of the molecule - (currently Linux only)    * chain_contact    * show_cpkHere are some movie commands, enter them and then push play, enjoy:    * surface_cartoon - slowly fades a surface onto a cartoon view    * ligand_pull - if there are ligands in the molecule this makes an animation of them being pulled from the molecule    * chain_pull - rolls through the different chains and highlights them    * rotate - rotates the molecule on its y-axis    * surface_stick - slowly fades from surface view to stick viewFor Fun:    * randomized - downloads a random pdb fileThe reason why there are some Linux only commands is because they make pymol crash in Windows, we are currently trying to fix the issue.
