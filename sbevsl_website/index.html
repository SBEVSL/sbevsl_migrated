<b>RESEARCH PLAN:</b>  There are many excellent visualization packages in structural biology.  Unfortunately, no single 
package meets the needs of the entire community and even an individual researcher may have to use 
several different packages in the course of an experiment.  One package may be used during structure 
solution to work with electron density maps and models, another package to interactively review 
configurations to achieve an understanding of the interaction of structure and function and to select 
views that will help to illustrate those points to others.  Yet other packages may be used for high quality 
publication renderings, movies and instructional tutorials.  Despite many decades of effort at integrating 
software for structural biology into comprehensive suites, the transition from program to program can 
still be clumsy and time-consuming. This unnecessary loss of time is compounded when one structural 
biologist communicates their findings or ideas to another structural biologist who uses different 
visualization and modeling software tools.

<P>

The goal of the SBEVSL project is to combine the full power that is currently available in molecular 
visualization with a level of ease of use that has not previously been achieved.  We will make tools 
available to the broadest possible audience in such a way that users familiar with one program can 
transport their scripts to another program without having to learn the subtleties of the command 
language for the new program.

<b>DEVELOPMENT SITE:</b>  The SBEVSL development site is a gforge site at Dowling College.  At a later date 
we will make a clone available on sourceforge.

<b>MEETINGS:</b>
 On 9 Sep 2006, H. Bernstein, I. Awuah Asimah, G. Darakev, N. Darakev and J. Jemilawon from 
 Dowling travelled to RIT to meet with P. Craig, B. Hanson and C. Westin to discuss work to be done 
 in starting up the project. It was agreed to go ahead with the division of labor as proposed, with 
 the RIT group starting by making a permissive plugin to accept scripts that might contain commands
  unrecognizable for pymol, logging the missed commands and recovering to the next command. The RIT 
  group would also provide a related capability to export either a log script or a current state 
  script which would note the input script commands that were skipped. The initial pass would use 
  any available object-oriented language, since going from such a language to UML is fairly easy. 
  The initial task for the Dowling group is work on a new SBEVSL dictionary defining the terms used 
  in molecular graphics building on the existing base of the mmCIF, imgCIF and symmetry CIf dictionaries.
  <P>
The target is for each group to provide something for evaluation to the other group within the next 2-3 months.
<p>

In terms of infrastructure, the RIT group was introduced to Dowling's gforge server and it was agreed 
to set up a videoconfercing system. N. Darakev and P. Craig would work on the initial setup.
<P>
Both groups explained the work that they do and achieved a good working rapport. It is 
clear that both sides bring different and complementary strengths to the project. The 
project seems off to a good start. -- HJB
