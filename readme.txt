ConSCRIPT is a product of the 

Structural Biology Extensible Visualization Language (SBEVSL)

project, supported in part by supported by Award Number R15GM078077 
from the National Institute Of General Medical Sciences. The content is 
solely the responsibility of the authors and does not necessarily represent 
the official views of the National Institute Of General Medical Sciences 
or the National Institutes of Health.‚Äù

The purpose of ConSCRIPT is to allow PyMOL to be used with RasMOL or
SBEVSL scripts and commands.

=========================================================================

ConSCRIPT Installation Instructions

ConSCRIPT is a plugin for PyMOL.  PyMOL is available as an open source
program from

http://sourceforge.net/projects/pymol/

and is incorpoated into many unix releases.  PyMOL is also available
in proprietary versions from

http://www.pymol.org.  See that website for information on PyMOL licensing.

PyMOL is a program that was written by the late Warren DeLano.  PyMOL
is a trademark of Schrodinger, LLC.  ConSCRIPT is a plugin for PyMOL,
not a derivative part of PyMOL, but depends on having a copy of PyMOL
in order to operate.

Therefore, in order to use ConSCRIPT, you first must have a copy of
PyMOL installed.

download PyMOL from http://pymol.sourceforge.net and install to 
default location

download ConSCRIPT.py from

http://downloads.sourceforge.net/sbevsl/ConSCRIPT-2.0rc3.tar.gz

and unpack ConSCRIPT.py from the kit.  On an MS Windows system,
if you do not have a suitable utility to read "tarballs", when
you double click ConSCRIPT-2.0rc3.tar.gz, they system should
suggest a program to download.  If it does not, you may wish to
consider using Stuffit Expander or WinZip.  On unix systems, or
using MINGW under windows you may unpack the tarball with

gunzip < ConSCRIPT-2.0rc3.tar.gz | tar xvf -

If you have not already done so, first install PyMOL.  Then,
the simplest way to install ConSCRIPT is by using the

Plugin->Manage Plugins->Install... menu

to install CONSCRIPT.py

To use that menu item, you need the same administrative rights as
were needed to install PyMOL, itself.  For example, under windows
you may need to be a system administrator, or under unix to have
root access (e.g. via sudo).

ALternatively, you may copy ConSCRIPT.py into the correct place
in the directory tree used by PyMOL for plugins.  For example,
for PyMOL 0.99 under MS windows:

  C:\Program Files\DeLano Scientific\pymol\modules\pmg_tk\startup\

On other systems you will need to find the portion of the pymol i
nstallation tree that contains 

   modules/pmg_tk/startup

and place ConSCRIPT.py in startup.  For example in a fink pymol
istallation for python 2.4, 2.5 or 2.6 under OSX under 

  /sw/lib/pymol-py24/modules/pmg_tk/startup
or
  /sw/lib/pymol-py25/modules/pmg_tk/startup
or
  /sw/lib/pymol-py26/modules/pmg_tk/startup

When all files are in place, the ConScript interface can be run by
choosing ConSCRIPT from the PyMOL plug-in menu.

General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) under Grant number 1R15GM078077-01.

Executing RasMol Scripts in PyMOL

There are many freely available molecular visualization programs 
used by scientists  to  view macromolecules.  Each application  has 
advantages.  However, each of these applications also has its own 
scripting language.   For scientists to  utilize  multiple  molecular 
visualization applications, they must learn  each  of those scripting 
languages.   To  unite  these applications, it is  necessary to  create 
tools to  interconvert these scripts according  to  the  conventions  of 
each program.  We have created a plugin that can read scripts from 
RasMol  and  execute  the  equivalent  commands  in  PyMOL. 
Challenges  have included  different sets  of commands and  object-
oriented  vs.  simple  text  formats.  It  is  the  goal  of  the  Structural 
Biology  Extensible  Visualization  Scripting  Language  project  to 
create  an interface  that will enable use of  scripts from one 
molecular  visualization  application  in  a  variety  of  other 
applications. This will enable users to run multiple programs while 
only needing to develop expertise in the scripting language for one 
of those programs. The project is funded in part by NIGMS grant 
#1R15GM078077.

A Rasmol to PyMOL Translator. Scott Mottarella, Brett Hanson, Charles Westin, 
Paul Craig, Herbert Bernstein, Biological Sciences, Rochester Inst. of Technology, 
85 Lomb Memorial Dr., Rochester, NY 14623 USA.

For many educators and scientists, PyMOL is the application of choice for preparing 
images and animations of their structures because of the beauty and quality of 
the images. However, many are most familiar with the scripting languages 
associated with RasMol, Chime and Jmol. The long-range goal of our Structural 
Biology Extensible Visualization Scripting Language project is to make the multiple 
molecular visualization tools available to the broadest possible audience, where 
each user can use many programs, with knowledge of the scripting language for
only one of those programs. The first step has been a comparison of the command 
sets for RasMol and PyMOL, followed by creation of a plug-in for PyMOL that will 
accept RasMol script files, translate the commands into PyMOL script and execute 
the commands. The process involves searching for recognized, valid, RasMol script
commands and performing its PyMOL equivalent, either as a single command or as a 
series of commands that produce the same result. Future plans include expansion to 
additional molecular visualization programs and the preparation of a web site to 
provide script translation among the various programs. The project is funded in 
part by NIGMS grant #1R15GM078077.

30 April 2008 -- HJB
   Unable to resolve selection problem with RGB.  Temporarily
reverted to trying to use PyMOL color name when possible in order
to restore operation of current test cases.  Moved to holding
current selection in a global VSLselection to help in debugging.
Added a VSLVerbose flag to make it easier to turn on debugging
messages. -- HJB 

26 April 2008 -- HJB

Add RasMol FetchToken as VSLFetchToken and rewrite Load command to use it
   Change all uses of SelectionSBEVSL VSLSelection
Add more of the RasMol infrastructure, including the command error
messages, the color name table converted to 0-1. instead of 0-255.
and the logic to parse RGB colors.
Provide hooks for command line SBEVSL command processing on a second tab.
The command line commands need to be enabled from the tab and then
entered with a VSL prefix.
In addition the code on VSLFetchToken has been changed to do individual
characters as -ord(ch) to avoid a conflict with tokens when unicode
characters are used in an identifier.

Note:  The update for the RGB parse is not yet complete.  The major
remaining problem seems to be that the color is not being applied
just to the current selection, but to more of the molecule

25 April 2008 -- SM (integrated by HJB)

Integrated mods by SM against base level into CVS at the 23 April level:
   Add user-defined groups via the "define" command
   Process "echo", "hbonds", "ssbonds"
   Change SBEVSLselected of prior mod to SelectionSBEVSL
   Add handling of colors by RGB triplets to handling of colors by name
   Accept empty lines and comment lines
   Rotate any loaded image by 180 around x
   

23 April 2008 -- HJB

Fixes to correct lost mod for restrict and to change to use of PyMOL 
SBEVSLselection selection name instead of variable named selected
to remember RasMol sticky selection between commands.

19 April 2008 -- HJB

Start of a restructuring to allow for nested scripts and handling of more commands:
    Create global variables filestack and filelevel to track nested scripts
    Add full copyright notice
    Change from "Script Editor" to "SBEVSL Script Loader"
    Allow "colour" as well as "color"
    Change to a standard for p in f loop to read lines
    Break up event handler into smaller routines:
       handlecommand( p ) to process a single command line p
       processSBEVSLscript( Q ) to process a script file Q
