Changelog for ProMOL 4.2

readme.txt:
	-Updated for current release.

__init__.py:
	-Removed Modified PDB loader plugin. Imported existing copy from pymol in line 7 and used it in line 32.
	-Removed unused tabs: toolboxes, movie maker, save module. Shouldn't have any major effect.

motifs.py:
	-Changed motif maker frame title to better reflect its purpose.

	-Line 39: Moved cancel button to its proper location.
	-Line 82: Removed  "?"  from Show Alignment checkbox.
	-Lines 87-97: Renamed Template to Motif and Motif to Query to better reflect their actual meaning. This is the color label when aligned in motif maker.
	
Help Folder:
	-Completely Removed. Will be re-implemented in later version.

AminoPics folder:
	-Completely removed as it was not being used.

utility.py, save.py, movie_maker.py, toolbox.py, advanced_toolbox.py:
	-All removed due to not being used.

motif.py:
	-Line 159: Consolidated two if statements into single statement.
	-Lines 181-188: Renamed Template to Motif and Motif to Query to better reflect their actual meaning.

	-Line 224: tag[1] replaced with motif name.
	-Line 226: Creates string used to name subset of Query subset. This is confusing, but documented more in depth in the code.

	-Lines 269: glb.populate() allows for hydrophobic/phillic, ligands, basic, acids residues to be selected on both query and motif.
	-Line 283: Created new variable to hold selected moifs to search for PERSISTENT replacement
	-Lines 448-461: Implemented new method for permuting substitution lists in JESS Set.
	-Lines 514-524: Removed lengtho, founds, and foundso as they were either commented or broken. Changed progress bar update loop structure to make more sense and to avoid going over 100%.
	-Lines 557-563: Replaced use of PERSISTENT to track keys in use since the class no longer exists. Changed strange method for computing number of keys.
	-Lines 568-570: Replaced cmd.fetch and method of detecting its success/error.
	-Lines 579-585: Moved cancel button check into inner loop from Lines 527-528.
	-Lines 589-600: Moved block that checks for match to above progress bar update.
	-Lines 605-606: Streamlined progress bar number formatting.
	-Lines 610-613: Added code to break out of outer loop as well in the case of a cancellation.
	-Line 637: Changed to the new subset of motifs since PERSISTENT class no longer exists.
	-Lines 693-713: Changed the csv export code to better wrap text and fixed the zero results infinite loop that caused the whole thing to hang when no matches are found.
	-Lines 718-723: Patched code due to lengtho-len(pdbs) not returning the correct number, this fixes the number of results display bug.
	-Lines 798, 808-809: Changed 'Motif Exist' to 'Motif Exists'
	-Line 821: Changed to use the new fetch pdb method
	-Line 839: Now loads motifs using new method.

movie.py:
	-Line 461: Removed duplicate call to cmd.extend
	-Line 494-503: Commented out loadframe, as w/o movie_maker it wouldn't function and only movie_maker needed it.
motd:
	-Updated to match current version and documentation status.

promolglobals.py:
	-Line 5: No longer import shelve as the PERSISTENT class doesn't exist.
	-Line 13: Changed version number
	-Lines 17-19: Added url of pdb entry type master list (for randomization), added empty motif dictionary to replace shelve database, added list to replace the keys used feature of PERSISTENT class.
	-Lines 32-33: Added new folder to OFFSITE folder for pdb downloads, as new fetch method would otherwise place them in the user's home directory
