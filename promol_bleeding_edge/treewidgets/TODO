To-Do List for TreeWidgets
==========================

* Implement CanvasTree

* Implement lazy instantiation of sub-trees. This is particularly valuable
  for potentially large data structures such as file systems; currently,
  regardless of how many levels are expanded in the display, the entire
  data structure must be read in and wrapped in TreeNode objects before 
  the tree is displayed.

* Implement Tkinter configuration options and font selection.

* Implement TreeWidget.showContentFunc, TreeWidget.showAttsFunc, and
  TreeWidget.glimpseFunc.
