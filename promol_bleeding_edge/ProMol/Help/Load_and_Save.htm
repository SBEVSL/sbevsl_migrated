<P><FONT face=Verdana>The<STRONG> </STRONG>Save&nbsp;button 
allows the user to save&nbsp;one frame to a new directory give the name of the 
Movie Title entry field entry and with the file extension specified in the File 
Extension entry field. The Frame entry field tells the user which frame number 
is going to be saved or loaded. This field can be manually set, however; the 
user must set it to the frame number before the frame of interest. </FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The Load button first prompts the user 
on whether the movie should be loaded in discrete mode and then opens the 
directory specified in the Movie title entry feild. As more frames are loaded 
the frame number increases to correspond with the current frame.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The Ray Trace Frames check box 
plays&nbsp;the movie back&nbsp;with each frame ray traced. This severly slows 
the movie progress, but is essential for creating an MPEG movie.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The Create PNGs button creats a series 
of numbered PNG (picture) files for which correspond a a frame of the movie. 
These PNGs are saved to the PyMol root folder and can be imported into a movie 
maker to make stand alone movies. If Ray Trace Frames is check, each frame will 
be ray trace, which vastly increases the quality of the movie.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The Frame Cache Off check box should 
be used for movies over 100 Frames long and keeps the RAM from being 
filled.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The Clear Ram button clears loaded 
froms from the computers RAM.</FONT>  </P>
