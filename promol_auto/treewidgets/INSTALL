Installing TreeWidgets
======================

If you have Python 2.0 or later installed, you should be able to install
TreeWidgets with the command:

    python setup.py install

Otherwise, you can either install the DistUtils package from:

    http://www.python.org/sigs/distutils-sig/download.html

or you can simply unpack the archive in your Python site-packages directory
(typically found at /usr/lib/python<version>/site-packages or
/usr/local/lib/python<version>/site-packages on POSIX systems, or at
C:\Python<version>\Lib\site-packages on Windows).
