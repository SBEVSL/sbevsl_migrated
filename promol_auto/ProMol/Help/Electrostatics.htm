<P><FONT face=Verdana>The formal and partial charges can be 
summed up and turned into a vacuum electrostatics potential map.&nbsp; The user 
must input the PDB code in capitals and then press the button.&nbsp; This will 
put a surface over the molecule demonstrating the positive and negative 
potentials.&nbsp; A ramp is also placed at the bottom of the screen and the 
potentials on the surface can be modified according to it by using Ctrl + middle 
mouse button.&nbsp; If the user wishes to get rid of the map and surface they 
can press the Remove button.&nbsp; Once again the PDB code must be in the 
entry.</FONT></P>
