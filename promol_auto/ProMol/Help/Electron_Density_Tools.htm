<H1><FONT face=Verdana size=5>Electron Density 
Tools</FONT>  </H1>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>This group contains numerous options 
for viewing electron densities of proteins.&nbsp; The calculations performed are 
derived from the PDB file parameters, and thusly these options can only be used 
on PDB files, and not on any constructed peptides or molecules.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The 
<STRONG>Mesh</STRONG>, <STRONG>Dots</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Surface</STRONG>     buttons 
all superimpose an electron density map calculated by PyMOL&nbsp;in the 
respective representation over an entire PDB file.&nbsp;</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>&nbsp;The 
<STRONG>Mesh Select</STRONG>, <STRONG>Dots Select</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Surface 
Select</STRONG>  
       buttons only work if a user has 
selected a portion of the protein or molecule in the PDB file.&nbsp; It is also 
contingent upon the selection retaining the name "sele" on the PyMOL internal 
GUI.&nbsp; If a user changes this name through manual commands on the PyMOL command line, 
then they will also not work.&nbsp; Once a user has selected the portion they would like 
to superimpose the electron density representation over they can press one of these 
three buttons and it will superimpose the density over only the selected area.&nbsp; 
Selecting a new area after this and pressing another selection will make the 
map over the previous selection disappear, and will superimpose it over the new selection.&nbsp; 
Thus if a user wants to superimpose&nbsp;a map&nbsp;over various selections spread out 
through a protein it is suggested that they use the sequence viewer to 
selectively choose the amino acids they are interested 
in.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The<STRONG> Roving 
Mesh</STRONG> and <STRONG>Roving Surface</STRONG> buttons both superimpose a map 
limited a small area of the protein.&nbsp; This map can be moved along the 
protein to view only a small area at a time on the protein using the middle 
mouse button.&nbsp; After clicking either of these buttons a user must hold down 
the middle mouse button and move the mouse cursor across the protein to drag the 
map along with it.&nbsp; To zoom or orient on a specific part of the protein the 
user can double click the middle mouse button, and the screen will center on 
this portion and superimpose the map over it.&nbsp; The breadth of the map that 
is superimposed can be controlled with the<STRONG> Roving Detail 
slider</STRONG>      
             
                  
           
               
                
              
             
              
  .&nbsp; The larger the number put on the slider, the larger 
the amount&nbsp;of protein that is superimposed with the map.&nbsp; After 
changing the number on the Roving Detail slider, the user must click again on 
either the Roving Mesh or Roving Surface button to enact the change.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The <STRONG>Double 
Resolution</STRONG>   button is used 
to increase the definition of the map, resulting in either more mesh lines, and 
a more distinct and full view of the map, or an increase in the amount of dots, 
also resulting in a more distinct a full view of the map.&nbsp; This helps to 
provide a more accurate and defined view of the map.&nbsp; Unfortunately 
doubling the resolution once will take up four times as much memory, and only 
high end computers can double the resolution more than once.&nbsp; Therefore it 
is suggested that a user does not use the Double Resolution button more than 
once, because it may lead to PyMOL crashing due to a lack of memory resources, 
and thusly a loss of unsaved work.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The<STRONG> 
Contour Slider</STRONG>   controls the 
volume taken up by the electron density map that has been created.&nbsp; Lower 
numbers make it take up a small volume and lowers the map closer to the protein 
backbone over which it is imposed.&nbsp; Higher numbers inflate it significantly 
and results in a larger volume expanded further away from the protein 
backbone.&nbsp; Once a number has been changed on the Contour slider the user 
must click again on their representation of choice to effect the change.&nbsp; 
Use of the Contour slider is suggested only for advanced use and individuals who 
understand the effect of changing the contour level upon the accuracy of the 
map.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana><FONT size=5>External Electron 
Density Mapping</FONT></FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=5>For advanced users </FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The 
<STRONG>External Map</STRONG>   button brings up a 
new window with many of the same options as on the normal Electron Density 
Mapping group.&nbsp; The difference resides in the fact that this tool is used 
for importing externally generated electron density maps derived from 
experimental X-Ray crystallographic data.&nbsp; </FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The entry field on 
the bottom right side of the window, with a label "<STRONG>Input PDB 
code</STRONG>" above it, is used to bring the user to a database of electron 
density maps.&nbsp; Once a user has input a known PDB code into the entry field, 
they must then press the <STRONG>Get Map</STRONG>       
                 
               
              
               
             
                 
            
             
              
             
              
           
            
               
             
             
            
            
            
                 
               
     button.&nbsp; This will take them directly to a 
download page for a map corresponding with the PDB code they have entered.&nbsp;</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>       
                 
               
              
               
             
                 
            
             
              
             
              
           
            
               
             
             
            
           Many 
PDBs are supported by this database, but some are not, so it 
is not guaranteed that they will have the PDB a user is looking for.&nbsp; Unfortunately there is 
no way to prevent the website from loading if it is indeed not supported.&nbsp; The 
user will find out immediately after pressing the "Generate Map" button the on 
the webpage, and it will be returned that the map does not exist.&nbsp;</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>       
                 
               
              
               
             
                 
            
             
              
             
              
           
            
               
         There is a dropdown 
selection menu on the webpage for "Map format", and the user must choose 
either O (the default), or CCP4, as these are the only two 
formats&nbsp;supported by PyMOL.&nbsp; Once the format has been selected click on the 
"Generate Map" button.&nbsp; Once the map has been generated it will display 
a link to the file that has been created.&nbsp; Right click on this file and select "Save 
Target As".&nbsp; This will allow the user to download the file to a specified path.&nbsp; 
After this it must be unzipped from its gunzip format.&nbsp; This will require 
something like Winzip, or WinRAR, or another unzipping utility that supports gunzip files.&nbsp;</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>After this the 
file can be loaded by PyMOL.&nbsp; This can be&nbsp;accomplished either through 
PyMOL itself, or the <STRONG>Load Map</STRONG> button.&nbsp; Since it is just a 
map the user will not be able to see anything at first.&nbsp; To visualize the 
downloaded map the user must input a name for the map in the <STRONG>Name Object 
entry</STRONG>, any name will do.&nbsp; This allows for PyMOL to manipulate the 
map.&nbsp; The user must also input the exact name of the file that they just 
downloaded in the <STRONG>Map Filename entry</STRONG>       
                 
               
              
               
             
                 
            
             
              
             
              
           
            
               
             
   .&nbsp; If the user plans on opening a PDB file 
to superimpose the downloaded map over it is also necessary to name 
the map something other than the PDB file name.&nbsp; Example:&nbsp; Using the 
PDB 1CHO and having downloaded the map 1CHO it is best to 
name the map 1CHOmap.&nbsp; This means in the entry field for filename I would now put 1CHOmap.&nbsp; 
This prevents PyMOL from getting confused over inconsistencies with file type and the commands it 
is being given.&nbsp; It is also best to input a name for&nbsp;the map 
in the Name Object entry that is different from the PDB file name.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>Once the map has been named and the 
file name input it is now possible to visualize the map.&nbsp; The 
<STRONG>Mesh</STRONG>,<STRONG> Dots</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Surface</STRONG> 
buttons all do the same thing as previously explained.&nbsp; The <STRONG>Mesh 
Select</STRONG>, <STRONG>Dots Select</STRONG>, and <STRONG>Surface 
Select</STRONG> buttons can only be used if a PDB has also been loaded, and has 
a portion selected.&nbsp; The same rules apply to this selection method as 
mentioned previously.&nbsp; The <STRONG>Contour scale</STRONG> also operates by 
the same mechanism as mentioned previously.</FONT>  </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>There is also a <STRONG>Help 
button</STRONG> on this interface which provides a quick reference for doing all 
that has been explained, although it is not as detailed as what has just been 
laid out.&nbsp; </FONT>  </P>
