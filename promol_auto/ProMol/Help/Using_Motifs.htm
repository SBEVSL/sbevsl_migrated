<P><FONT face=Verdana>The motifs tab 
allows users to find pre-defined motifs using selection algebra written by 
Charlie Westin and Brett Hanson. This is done by clicking the drop-down menu of 
interest and selecting the motif the users believe may be in their protein. The 
selection algebra is run and the motif is returned represented as sticks on top 
of the proteins overall structure shown as a cartoon. The resiudes around the 
active site can also be shown using the adjacent button and the distance slider 
specifying the amount of angstroms&nbsp;around the motif to display.&nbsp; Since 
this is solely based on measurements of individual atoms in specified residues 
to individual atoms in other residues, it is possible 
to return false positives.&nbsp; False negatives may also be returned, but to accomodate 
for both of these shortcomings it is possible to slide the precision factor 
bar to change the multiplier of the default measured values.&nbsp; Moving the slider to the 
right increases the probability of returns by allowing for residues within a greater 
distance to be accepted.&nbsp; Moving it to the left makes it much more specific 
and reduces the allowable distances returned.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT face=Verdana>Once the motif 
has been returned and displayed as sticks, the user can then add one of the 
various options for the active site. A surface can be added enabling the user to 
find the pocket or surface contact of the motif.&nbsp; The user must look for the colored regions on 
the white transparent surface to determine these sites.&nbsp;Also residue labels, polar contacts and bound substrates can 
be shown or hidden. Resources for the&nbsp;protein of interest are at the bottom 
of the page and include, the Abstract based on input PDB code, FASTA sequence 
download based on input PDB code, FASTA site link, and a link to the 
PDB databank. The resources require an internet connection.</FONT></P>
