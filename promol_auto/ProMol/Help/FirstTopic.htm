<p><font size="3" font face="Verdana">Pymol is a molecular modeling program that can be used in a wide range of 
studies within the scientific commnity.&nbsp; Its ability to produce 
informative, detailed, steroescopic images makes it a very powerful tool in the 
laboratory and the in the classroom.&nbsp; However, the PyMOL user interface is 
difficult to use and it's "development has been focused on capabiliites, not on 
ease-of-use for new users." (PyMOL Users Manual) To resolve this, we set out to 
develop a new interface for PyMOL that can be installed as a plugin and helps to 
eliminate the need for command line interactions, making it a much more 
user-friendly interface.&nbsp; Using tools from Python's Tkinter and Pmw 
toolkits, we created a tabbed interface called EZ-Viz.&nbsp; The interface 
contains a series of buttons and entry fields that allow users to select given 
attributes of a molecule and make changes to it with the click of a button as 
opposed to issuing highly syntactical commands.&nbsp; Other features of the 
interface include</FONT> </p>

<p><font size="3" font face="Verdana">The 
ongoing and continued devlopment of EZ-Viz could help to further the use of 
PyMOL, which we believe to be one of the most powerful molecular viewing 
programs currently available.</FONT> </p>  <font
