make changes to an image in the PyMOL viewing window, a set of syntactical 
commands must be issued to achieve the desired result.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>  The buttons and menus found 
within the EZ-Viz interface take away most of the need to issue commands, however 
some more advanced users may still want to have the option of issuing their own 
commands available to them.<SPAN style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>To 
accommodate more advanced users, we have added an entry field to the Commands 
tab in which both PyMOL and Chime commands can be entered and executed.<SPAN 
style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </SPAN>The effects of an executed Chime command 
will appear on the molecule currently in the PyMOL viewing window just as they 
would had the command been executed through PyMOL’s own command 
line.</SPAN>
