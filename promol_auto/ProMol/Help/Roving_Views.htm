<H1>Roving Views</H1>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>This setting will allow a user to 
view only a small portion of the protein at a time, dragging the selected 
representation along the length of the backbone using the middle mouse 
button.&nbsp; If the user doesn't have a middle mouse button they can switch 
mouse modes and accomodate accordingly.&nbsp; Use the PyMOL help manual to 
discern new control schemes.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>There are four 
preset roving views excluding the electron density roving settings.&nbsp; These 
include roving sticks, roving lines, roving ball and stick, and roving 
spheres.&nbsp; The importance of this viewing method resides in the ability to 
discard with the background clutter of residues in the protein concentrating on 
only the portion of interest.&nbsp; A slider is also associated with these 
roving views allowing a user to control how large a portion of the protein is 
demonstrated as the chosen representation at a time.&nbsp; Moving the slider to 
the left will reduce the amount shown.&nbsp; After altering the slider the user 
must re-click on the roving representation of choice to enact the change.&nbsp;
