Distributed ProMOL: In Vitro Protein Function Assignment

ProMOL is open source software for in vitro protein function assignment -- developed by RIT students in collaboration with Dowling College. The Protein Data Bank (PDB) contains over 100,000 protein structures. However, thousands of these structures have no annotated function. 

The inter-atomic distance fingerprint of a catalytic site constitutes the 'Motif' of its catalytic function. ProMOL utilizes catalytic site specifications from the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA) and other databases, to derive the Motifs of catalytic sites from the annotated structures in the PDB. By querying unannotated structures for the presence of Motifs, ProMOL leverages the annotated structures to assign putative functions to the thousands of uncharacterized structures in the PDB.


Generating motifs, validating motifs, and querying protein structures for motifs are computation-intensive tasks. 

Without Research Computing resources, these calculations would take many years to complete -- a prohibitive time frame.
