<P><FONT face=Verdana>This group 
contains various modes a user can enter for 
visualization and editing.&nbsp;</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The <STRONG>Sculpting button 
</STRONG>lets the user enter sculpting mode in which all aspects of the molecule 
or protein can be manipulated.&nbsp; The balloon pop up over the button details 
the controls, which are: Ctrl + Right click to drag a single atom, and Ctrl + 
Left click to rotate bonds.&nbsp; This can be useful for a variety of tasks, but 
cannot be depended on for accurate representations of molecules in three 
dimensional space.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The <STRONG>Measurement Tool 
button</STRONG> lets a user determine the distance between two atoms in a given 
molecule or protein.&nbsp; Once a user enters measurement mode they must click 
on the first atom, and then the second atom to get a distance.&nbsp; This will 
be shown by a dashed yellow line with a number midway through it.&nbsp; To turn 
off measurement mode the user must use the internal GUI on PyMOL, in which other 
options are also provided.</FONT> </P>
<P><FONT face=Verdana>The <STRONG>Sequence Viewer 
button</STRONG> can be used to view the sequence of a protein, peptide, DNA, 
RNA, and numerous other components of molecules.&nbsp; There are four different 
modes for the sequence viewer.&nbsp; There is a <STRONG>One letter mode</STRONG> 
which displays the sequence of a protein in one letter format corresponding to 
the standard&nbsp;one letter code assigned to amino acids.&nbsp; <STRONG>Three 
letter mode</STRONG> displays the sequence corresponding to the standard three 
letter code assigned to amino acids.&nbsp; <STRONG>AA atoms</STRONG> displays 
every single atom in the molecule and&nbsp;shows them linearly by residue 
number, and goes by a nomenclature indicating where in the amino acid the atom 
resides.&nbsp; This nomenclature must be looked up for more information.&nbsp; 
The last mode is <STRONG>Chains</STRONG> which simply shows all chains in the 
protein according to the alphabetized name they have been given.&nbsp; When 
viewing any of the first three modes it can be difficult to discern where one 
peptide chain ends and another begins.&nbsp; This is illustrated in the 
following picture.</FONT> </P>

<P><FONT face=Verdana>The beginning of a new chain starts 
with the a space between the two chains, and then a / and the letter of the new 
chain.&nbsp; An easy tool to find where chains start and end is to use the 
"Color by Chain" preset, which will result in the sequence viewer coloring each 
chains listed residues separately, as shown above.</FONT></P>
