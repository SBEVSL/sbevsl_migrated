 The EZ-Viz graphical user interface (GUI) was devloped as a plugin 
for Delano Scientific's molecular cisualization program, PyMOL. It features a notebook 
style design with separate tabs to distinguish one section from another.&nbsp; There are 
a total of nine tabs with the titles; Welcome, Presets, 
Settings, Commands, Movies, Information, Advanced, Save, and About. Each 
individual tab has a series of buttons, menus, and entry fields which the 
user can employ to manipulate the appearance of their molecule in 
PyMOL’s viewing window. An additional row of buttons is displayed along the bottom of 
the EZ-Viz window at all times.&nbsp; These buttons are used 
primarily for loading files into the PyMOL viewer, accessing the help file, 
clearing the viewing window, and quitting EZ-Viz.The interface utilizes a PDB file parser 
that is used to identify the separate structures that exist within the molecule 
that is currently being viewed. 
Using this information, the program creates a number of unique objects in 
PyMOL, such as DNA, RNA and protein that can be individually altered. If a molecule does not contain a certain 
type of structure, such as DNA, an object will not be created for 
it.</p></FONT>

<p><font >  <font size="3"><font >      &nbsp;On this tab you will 
also find the&nbsp;Chime/PyMOL converter.&nbsp; The converter&nbsp;will allow&nbsp;you to input&nbsp;either Chime or PyMOL 
commands into and entry field&nbsp;and&nbsp;have the command executed in the PyMOL viewer 
window.Also, the radio&nbsp;buttons found here allow you to control some of the 
features of the PyMOL Viewing window.&nbsp; You can turn on 
stereo viewing for cool 3D images, 
change the background color to make you image stand out, 
and even hide the original PyMOLinterface.&nbsp;</font> </font> </font> </p>

<p><font >  <font size="3"><font >Here you will find a series of pre-defined views that you may 
want to use to view your molecule.&nbsp; Some of the views include 
a&nbsp;default view that distinguishes alpha helices from beta sheets, a color 
by chain view, and a ball and stick model.</font> This tab also 
contains all the buttons you need to select attributes of your molecule 
(protein, DNA, chains, water molecules, etc.) and change the way they appear in 
the viewer.&nbsp; You can show and hide molecular representations, such as 
spheres, mesh, sticks, and surface, as well as change the 
colors.&nbsp; </font> </font> </p>

   This tab gives the&nbsp;you&nbsp;more control over what the 
representations you're seeing in the viewing window.&nbsp; Some of the features 
you'll have control over are the&nbsp;size of spheres and sticks, the width and 
thickness of cartoon, and the ability to make the molecule transparent.</font>

some of the things you'll find here.</font> </font> </p>

can be&nbsp;created with almost any molecule that you bring into PyMOL.&nbsp; 
There is also a control panel that allows you to control the playback of the 
movie after its been created.&nbsp;</font></p>
