<H1>Customizable Motifs</H1>
<P><FONT face=Verdana size=3>For those who cannot find the 
motif they want in the predefined motifs the ability to specify a motif is 
available.&nbsp; It runs on the same algebra, but is not as specific since it is 
not measuring specific atoms against each other.&nbsp; It is used to check to 
see if whole residues are within a certain angstrom distance from one 
another.&nbsp; The top of this tab contains the simpler and easier to use 
"linear" motif, in which a measured distance is specified for selections&nbsp;A, 
B, C, and or D.&nbsp; A is measured to B, B to C, and C to D.&nbsp; The more 
complex method entails a specification of all 4 against&nbsp;one another.&nbsp; 
All selections also have accompanying sliders to control the angstrom range 
which is acceptable to return.&nbsp; </FONT></P>
